# Data Ingestion

## What do we need from an API?

### Daily Close Price
To determine the quantity ratio for the day, so that notional is equal-weighted.

Should be available as raw data in any API.

### Daily Market Capitalization Data
To determine which 100 stocks will be included in the index. We will need daily historical values to determine historical composition(for at least 30 days)
#### Two possible approaches:
- Direct market cap value from last 30 days
- Calculated using (shares outstanding Ã— daily price) from last 30 days
